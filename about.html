        <h1>College Profile</h1>
        <p>Gangarampur College was established in 1981 in Gangarampur Block of Dakshin Dinajpur district, as a Co-educational Institute of higher learning with the objective of expanding the scope of higher education to all in one of the remotest districts of West Bengal. The College has moved forth to achieve the desired fruition of its goals in the following years. Lapped cosily on the eastern bank of the river Punarbhaba the College is part of a rich heritage of Indian culture of yore clutching on to the glory of the legendary king Vana (the remains of whose kingdom are found in Bangarh – a heritage site of archaeological importance – 3 kilometers to the north of the College).</p>
